save__diffrn_refln.gphl_image_id
    _item_description.description
;              The identifier of the diffraction image this reflection
               is associated with. This is often the image where the
               calculated reflection centroid is predicted to occur.

save__diffrn_refln.gphl_detector_x
    _item_description.description
;              Detector coordinate (in pixels) along the X-direction
               for this reflection. This is often the position where
               the calculated reflection centroid is predicted to occur.

               The detector X-direction is most often along the fast
               changing array index of the 2D diffraction array, while
               the Y-coordinate is along the slow changing array
               index.
